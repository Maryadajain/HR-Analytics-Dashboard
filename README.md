# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I believe dashboards should tell a story — not just display numbers. This project reflects that mindset by combining logic (DAX), creativity (visuals), and empathy (user-focused design) to create a tool that's both informative and engaging.

# Purpose
A story-driven HR Dashboard built using Power BI that transforms raw employee data into interactive, insightful visuals. The goal is to help HR teams and business leaders monitor workforce trends, improve employee engagement, and make data-informed decisions with clarity and confidence.

# Tech Stack
Power BI - Data visualization and dashboard creation
DAX -	Custom KPIs and logic implementation
Power Query	- Data transformation and cleaning

# Features / Highlights
Interactive Dashboard Pages: Navigate easily across multiple sheets (Overview, Demographics, Attrition, etc.) using Navigator Tool

DAX-Driven KPIs: Custom calculations for metrics like Attrition Rate, Tenure Buckets, Gender Ratio, and more

Feature Engineering: Created age bands, tenure groupings, and satisfaction scores for deeper insights

Visual Variety: Bar charts, pie charts, KPI tiles, line graphs — all designed for intuitive understanding

User-Friendly Navigation: Slicers and filters for department, gender, role, and employment type

Ready for integration with real-time HR datasets
